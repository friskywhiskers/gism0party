# gism0grifier

A gism0 image transmogrifier in Python. 

## Steps for success

1. Make a dumb mask
2. Make a dumb python script using [opencv?](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.1/d0/d86/tutorial_py_image_arithmetics.html) - input: picture output: picture with mask on it
3. Improve dumb script to use opencv or something to find face boxes for pictures and overlay dumb mask
4. Look at what you have done and figure out how to split masks or otherwise do alignment

### Someday

* Make a website at [gism0.party](https://gism0.party)
* Improve dumb script to do zooming and output series
* Figure out [how to call script from website](https://serverlesscode.com/post/python-3-on-serverless-framework/)
